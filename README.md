About this app

The Car2Go app is an online rideshare site where users whether offering a ride or in need of one can post their itineraries online. Carpooling can reduce transport cost by up to 75 percent and reduce carbon emissions. A driver can create a trip and post it on the home page. A rider can choose a trip they are interested in and contact the driver and become a ride buddy.
